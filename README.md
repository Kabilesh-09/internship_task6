### 🔐 Passwords Tested

| Password | Strength | Time to Crack | Feedback |
|-----------|-----------|----------------|-----------|
| kabilesh123 | Weak | 2 seconds | Add uppercase and symbols |
| Kabilesh@2025 | Medium | 4 hours | Increase length |
| K@b!2025learn# | Strong | 5 years | Good complexity |
| Sunrise$at!Beach2025 | Very Strong | 40+ years | Very secure and long |

---

### 📊 Observations
- Passwords with **mixed characters (A-Z, a-z, 0-9, symbols)** are more secure.  
- **Longer passwords** take exponentially more time to crack.  
- Simple names or numbers make passwords easy targets for **dictionary or brute-force attacks**.  
- **Passphrases** are both strong and easy to remember.

---

### 💡 Best Practices
1. Use **12+ characters** minimum.
2. Include **uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols**.
3. Avoid personal info (name, DOB, etc.).
4. Use **unique passwords** for each account.
5. Prefer **passphrases** (e.g., `Sun@Rise!atTheBeach2025`).
6. Enable **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)** wherever possible.
7. Use a **password manager** to store passwords securely.

---

### 🔍 Key Concepts
- **Brute Force Attack:** tries every possible combination.
- **Dictionary Attack:** uses a list of common passwords or words.
- **Passphrase:** a sequence of words that’s long but memorable.
- **MFA:** adds another verification layer beyond the password.

---

### 🧾 Outcome
Understood how password complexity affects strength and learned to create strong, secure passwords for digital safety.
