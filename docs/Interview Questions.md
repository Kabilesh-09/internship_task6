Interview Questions and Answers

1. What makes a password strong?
A strong password is long, unique, and hard to guess. It mixes letters, numbers, and symbols.

2. What are common password attacks?
Common ones are brute-force (trying all combinations), dictionary (using word lists), and phishing (tricking users to share passwords).

3. Why is password length important?
Longer passwords take much more time for attackers to crack, making them more secure.

4. What is a dictionary attack?
It’s when hackers use a list of common words or passwords to guess your password.

MFA adds an extra layer of protection — like a code sent to your phone or a fingerprint — along with your password.

6. How do password managers help?
They safely store all your passwords and can generate strong new ones, so you don’t have to remember them.

7. What are passphrases?
A passphrase is a long password made of random words that are easier to remember, like “BlueDogRunsFast!”

Using short, simple, or reused passwords, or personal info like names and birthdays.
